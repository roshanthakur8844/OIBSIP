# Oasis Infobyte Python Programming Internship

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Oasis Infobyte Python Programming Internship. This repository contains the code and descriptions for the tasks I have completed as part of the internship program.


## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: BMI Calculator

The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a Python script that allows users to calculate their BMI based on their height and weight. The BMI is a measure that uses height and weight to work out if a person's weight is healthy.

- **File:** `BMI_CALCULATOR.py`
- **Functionality:**
  - Takes user input for height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms).
  - Calculates the BMI using the formula: `BMI = weight / (height * height)`.
  - Outputs the BMI value along with a category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obesity).

### Task 2: Random Password Generator

The Random Password Generator is a Python script designed to create strong, random passwords to enhance security.

- **File:** `Random_Password_Generator.py`
- **Functionality:**
  - Generates a password of user-defined length.
  - Includes a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
  - Ensures the generated password meets common security standards.

### Task 3: Voice Assistant

The Voice Assistant is a Python-based virtual assistant that can perform various tasks based on voice commands.

- **File:** `Voice_Assistant.py`
- **Functionality:**
  - Recognizes and processes voice commands.
  - Can perform tasks such as searching the web, opening applications, telling the current time, and more.
  - Utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries for interaction.
